# Contributing to Oblivion

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Oblivion! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6000.2.2f1 or later
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of C# and Unity development

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Open the project in Unity
4. Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Unity's C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public methods
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility

### Script Organization
- Place scripts in appropriate folders under `Assets/Scripts/`
- Use namespaces when appropriate
- Follow the existing folder structure:
  - `Core/`: Essential game systems
  - `Player/`: Player-specific functionality
  - `Health/`: Damage and health systems
  - `Weapons/`: Weapon and combat systems
  - `VFX/`: Visual effects scripts

### Component Design
- Use interfaces for extensibility (follow `IDamageable` pattern)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use Unity events for loose coupling between systems
- Make components configurable via Inspector when appropriate

## üîß Development Areas

### Current Systems
- **Combat System**: Magic and melee combat mechanics
- **Input System**: Gamepad and keyboard controls
- **Targeting System**: Auto-aim and enemy targeting
- **VFX System**: Particle effects and visual feedback
- **Damage System**: Health, damage calculation, and status effects

### Areas for Contribution
- **Enemy AI**: Behavior systems for different enemy types
- **Level Design**: New environments and challenges
- **Audio System**: Sound effects and music integration
- **UI/UX**: Menus, HUD, and user interface improvements

## üéÆ Game Design Principles

### Combat Balance
- Magic attacks should have clear advantages and disadvantages
- Melee combat should feel responsive and impactful
- Enemy encounters should be challenging but fair

### Visual Design
- Maintain fantasy theme consistency
- Ensure VFX don't obscure gameplay
- Keep visual style cohesive across assets

### Performance
- Target 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- Optimize for mobile platforms when possible
- Use object pooling for frequently spawned objects
